What I did this week

At the start of the week, I was learning about environment variables in the command line. Environment variables allow you to store values you may frequently use, meaning you get to use them as shortcuts. Environment variables can be created for
a session on the terminal, but will be removed when session ends or won't be available for a seperate session. To save environment variables for multiple sessions, they must be created in the .bashrc file. 

I then refreshed my memory on REST API building and working on React apps. I've gotten more comfortable with API's and databases now and I'm confident I will master them soon. I also got to learn about using API's created by other developers, such 
as the openAI API. At first I had trouble connecting to the openAI API but I eventually figured it out and had fun with it. 

I and the rest of the class recently started taking a Udemy fullstack web development bootcamp. So far I've completed three modules, which were mostly a revision of work we have covered last year, like html and css. Even as revision, I still enjoy the course very 
much and seeing how easy it is to learn from it now makes me believe I won't have a challenge when I get to the more difficult modules.
